# MED27_analysis
Analysis of variants of MED27 (no mutant data is stored here)

MED27 is part of the mediator complex. This is a huge complex.

## Mammalian MED27

A [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.05.326918v1.full) has the full mammalian complex (PDB: 6W1S).

> See [prep notes](complex_prep.md) for energy minisimation
> See [analysis notes](complex_scoring.md) for scoring

Many of the scripts are common so are in [my pyrosetta scripts repo](https://github.com/matteoferla/pyrosetta_scripts)

## Model building

Prior to finding the preprint, I [attempted to make a model](model_attempts.md).

## Consurf

[Consurf](https://consurf.tau.ac.il/) was then used to add conservation as b-factors.

## gnomAD

gnomAD has weird transcript issues again. The correct transcript is used in v3: `MED27-201`/`ENST00000292035.10`, which is 311.
While the longer (326aa) `MED27-207`/`ENST00000651950.1` is wrong.
There is a single homozygous variant, p.Val203Ile, 
and only a few heterozygous variants in the `gnomad_r3_controls_and_biobanks` dataset
(p.Ala2Val, p.Ile5Val, p.Ser26Phe, p.Lys36Arg, p.Ala150Thr, p.Pro174Ala, p.Val203Ile, p.Pro280Leu)
that a frequency greater than 5e-5.

## MSA

> See [MSA notes](MSA.md)

In the final figure human, mouse (because the model is mouse), zebrafish, fruit fly, red coral, a basal fungus and thale cress were used.

## Other

### Humanise

> See [humanise notes](humanise.md)

It is mouse, but there are only a few missenses with human for MED27 (L5I, S6N, G8S, N55H, S220N, S235N).

I started to convert the whole complex automatedly, but got bogged down and never finished: see [humanise](humanise.md).
Especially given that there are 6 missenses, most in spans lacking density.

### Hydrate

> See [hydrate notes](hydrate.md)

Being a big complex of small protein it is very solvent exposed.
This is problematic for calculating interface energy when using implicit solvent â€”cf. barnase-barnstar, G-protein &alpha;-&beta;.
Hydration however was not the cause of curious results.
