## RMSD
This is the other way

    print(scorefxn_cart(mid), scorefxn_cart(ori), rmsd.calculate(mid))
    
    
## LocalRelax weights

These are the weights as seen in the [Wang et al 2016](https://elifesciences.org/articles/17219) paper

    # <Set scale_sc_dens_byres="E:0.56,D:0.56,R:0.76,K:0.76,M:0.76,C:0.81,Q:0.81,H:0.81,N:0.81,T:0.81,S:0.81,Y:0.88,W:0.88,A:0.88,F:0.88,P:0.88,I:0.88,L:0.88,V:0.88"/>
    # is an utter mystery.
    weights = {"cart_bonded_length": 0.5,
               "cart_bonded_torsion": 0.5,

## I-Tasser

Clean ITasser records.

## Consurf

I don't recall which I used, so here are both...
